This fork delete the new creative tab created by this mod (because it conflicts with other mods I use, and I'll add a toggle to that function and make a pull request as long as I know how to do so.).

# Visible Barriers

Visible Barriers is a useful mod for mapmakers and map playtesters.

It adds multiple tools for mapmaking and testing, namely the ability to render barrier blocks as solid blocks using a keybind (default: b).

Also includes various tools such as a creative tab of unlisted blocks, commands to mass infect and lock blocks, and the ability to see marker entities.
